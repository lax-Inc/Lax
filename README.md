# Lax Programming Language

## Overview

**Lax** is a high-level, user-friendly programming language developed by Lax Inc. It is engineered to be a normal, very easy-to-learn language that provides a smooth experience for developers. While it can create native Linux binaries and handle system-level tasks, its design focuses on simplicity and readability, making it accessible for everyone.

The design philosophy of **Lax** prioritizes intuitive abstractions over unnecessary complexity. Unlike complicated languages, Lax allows you to get results quickly with minimal code, providing a powerful yet "light" environment for modern development.

## Technical Specifications

* **File Extension:** `.lx`
* **Execution Model:** Direct execution / Native Linux Binary
* **Paradigm:** High-level Multi-paradigm / Functional-Logic
* **Instruction Set:** Total of 143 core commands (137 operations in `com.h` and 6 interface functions in `Lax.c` example `help` or `exit` etc.)

## Core Mechanics

### Simple Character Handling

The Lax compiler is designed to be modern and efficient. It supports standard character processing, allowing developers to work with text and data in a natural way. The internal logic is optimized to handle string operations without the burden of manual bit-level manipulation found in older systems.

## Commands and Syntax

The instruction set is concise and powerful, containing a total of **143 commands** (137 defined in `com.h` and 6 core interfaces in `Lax.c`). All commands are strictly lowercase and follow a logical, easy-to-remember structure.

**Example Syntax Logic:**

* Functions and execution calls are structured for maximum clarity.
* Text comments or metadata like assembly language: `; Example comment`.
* High-level abstractions handle I/O operations, keeping the code clean and readable.
